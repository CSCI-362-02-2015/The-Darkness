Test Plan: We will be testing specific modules in the HFOSS program, Sugar Labs.  There are specific methods in each module, and we will be ensuring integrity across functionality of the methods we plan to test.
Module: finance.py is the file that we will be testing.  Methods we will be testing will include:
update_summary, get_this_period, get_next_period, create_transaction

Test Cases: Create a Transaction
We plan to input the variables needed to create a transaction and check the values once the program has terminated to ensure accuracy.  We will test with a positive integer transaction, with small decimal transactions, with negative transactions and with positive and negative transactions.
