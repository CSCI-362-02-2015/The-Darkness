Deliverable 1
	Evergreen is a software that helps libraries handle, manage, and gather materials.  It is a program made for libraries of varying size.  One of the main prerequisites for Evergreen to run is the routing network called openSRF.  It was when The Darkness tried to run openSRF, that we realized we were in over our heads.  OpenSRF requires an xmpp; the choice for their project was Jabber.  Jabber is necessary for two networks to communicate and it lets the networks communicate at almost real time.  We could not get openSRF to run once we configured it, and our team has decided to switch HFOSS software for our tests.
